# My E-commerce websites

I decided to create E-commerce website which will offer games for different platforms like PC, Play Station. The website will consists of multiple pages including Home page, games, pre-orders and retro games. 


So far the biggest challenge during my website development was creating the break points. As I created my website for the big screens I needed to completely rework my CSS to make it mobile first website. Once, I created the website for the mobile phones resolutions which is 360 pixels wide I could create break points for tablet and desktop resolutions. I set up the breakpoints at minimum width 500 pixels for tablets and 900 pixels for desktop computers [2].
Once I created the breakpoints I could test it on different screen resolutions. I used Inspect tool on Chrome web browser to display it on different devices. The design and all the elements changed as I changed it to the different widths.

I used HTML to create the pages for my website and CSS to style them so they have nice design and look professional. Also I used a java script to create image gallery for one of my products as well as create a Google map on my help.html page [1]. To display my products I used technique used figcaption that allowed me to display images with short description on hover. To create it I used module materials found on blackboard. On the retro games page I used css gallery with zoom [3] which enlarges the images of products once the user hover them. The register and sign-in pages contain forms that allow user to enter login and register credentials [4]. Also there is a search bar on each page [5].

I used the same css style for every page. Although, I had to modify the content section for each page as it displays different information such as images, forms, texts, maps. 

As I could not add any images to the readme file I created a separate folder called readme attachments where I will save the diagarams and pages designs.
