# My E-commerce websites

I decided to create E-commerce website which will offer games for different platforms like PC, Play Station. The website will consists of multiple pages including Home page, games, pre-orders and retro games. 

I used HTML to create the pages for my website and CSS to style them so they have nice design and look professional. Also I used a java script to create image gallery for one of my products [6] as well as create a Google map on my help.html page [1]. To display my products I used technique used figcaption that allowed me to display images with short description on hover. To create it I used module materials found on blackboard. On the retro games page I used css gallery with zoom [3] which enlarges the images of products once the user hover them. The register and sign-in pages contain forms that allow user to enter login and register credentials [4]. Also there is a search bar on each page [5].

So far the biggest challenge during my website development was creating the break points. As I created my website for the big screens I needed to completely rework my CSS to make it mobile first website. Once, I created the website for the mobile phones resolutions which is 360 pixels wide I could create break points for tablet and desktop resolutions. I set up the breakpoints at minimum width 500 pixels for tablets and 900 pixels for desktop computers [2].

I used the same CSS style for every page. However, I had to modify the content section for each page as it displays different information such as images, forms, texts, maps. 

I used HTML and CSS validators to check if there are any errors in my code. The Checkers displayed no errors. However, there were few warnings called “Section lacks headings”. As I used sections called banner or search bar there is no need for adding any headings to them.

The website has been tested on three different browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. The website is displayed properly on each browser and there are no errors. However, Mozilla Firefox did not display Arial Black font style and changed to different one. All CSS and JS galleries as well as map are displayed correctly.  Once I created the breakpoints I could test it on different screen resolutions. I used Inspect tool on Chrome web browser to display it on different devices. The design and all the elements changed sizes as I changed it to the different widths.

For some reason the map is not loading when the help page is opened on github pages. You need to refresh the page to display the map.

I could not add any images to the readme file so I created a separate folder called readme attachments where I will save the diagrams and pages designs. As you can see my initial designs differ from my final webpages. I decided to change it a little because I thought it will look better.
