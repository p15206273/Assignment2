# My E-commerce websites

I decided to create E-commerce website which will offer games for different platforms like PC, Play Station. The website will consists of multiple pages including Home page, games, sale, pre-orders and retro games. 



So far the biggest challenge during my website development was creating the break points. As I created my website for the big screens I needed to completely rework my CSS to make it mobile first website. Once, I created the website for the mobile phones resolutions which is 360 pixels wide I could create break points for tablet and desktop resolutions. I set up the breakpoints at minimum width 500 pixels for tablets and 900 pixels for desktop computers.
